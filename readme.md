## Getting started

In your directory, run:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/ragingwind/electron-psk-boilerplate/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 2
```

You can also `git clone` or [download](https://github.com/ragingwind/electron-psk-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) this repo and get contents of the `boilerplate` folder.

Yet ~~There's also a [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/ragingwind/generator-electron).~~


## Patch for running route properly

Until v1.1.1 for PSK, You should add the following code to `src/app/elements/routing.html`. See [the doc](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/chrome-dev-editor.md) for further information.

```
page('*', function() {
  page.redirect('/');
});
```
